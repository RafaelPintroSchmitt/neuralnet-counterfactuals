# Now, I create a list containing the graphs of each election. Each graph is a tensor_geometric Data object, which contains the adjacency matrix and the features of each node. The graph structure is defined by linking each city to it's 10 closest peers (in terms of geographical distance).
# 
# Roughly, I take the datasets for the years 2010 through 2022 and I define the output vector (Y) as the difference in vote-share in the runoff for the PT (workers party) between the current and last election. The X matrix, containing covariates, includes city-level covariates extracted from the Brazilian 2010 census. Note that it also includes the output vector (difference in vote-share). The goal here is to train the network by (1) dropping some cities in the training set arbitralily, and (2) predicting the vote-share of the PT in those cities through convolutions/attention layers. That is, I leverage "local" voting patterns to extrapolate voting behavior to the omitted-outcome cities. The network should thus be learning an underlying geographical contagion/distribution process of voting behavior. In evaluating the model, I will only use cities out of the training set. In particular, I will drop "diff" for half the cities in the test set and predict their vote-share based on the other half (see the definition of Z).
# 
# I also define treatment variables here - i.e. I drop the "labels" or outcomes of the treated cities, and will use the non-dropped controls to predict the counterfactuals for the treated cities.

# I now turn to defining the model. I will use a Graph Attention Network (GAT). I have a dropout layer, which omits the information of some nodes in each layer. I then have two GAT layers, with a RELU activation function in between, which are the core of the model. Finally, I have a linear layer, which outputs the predicted vote-share for the PT in each city. The model is defined as follows:

# %%
import torch.nn as nn
import random
j = random.randint(0, 1000)
class GAT(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        torch.manual_seed(j)
        self.conv1 = GATConv(in_features, in_features, heads=2)
        self.conv2 = GATConv(in_features*2, in_features, heads=2)
        self.lin1 = Linear(in_features*2, out_features)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_attr):
        #make drops start at 0.9 and decrease by 0.05 every 10 epochs, until it reaches 0.5
        drops = 0.9 - (0.05 * (epoch // 10))
        if drops < 0.5:
            drops = 0.5
        x = F.dropout(x, p=drops, training=self.training)
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index, edge_attr)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index, edge_attr)
        x = self.lin1(x)
        return x

# The training of the model is simple: for every epoch I actually take one optimization step for each election included in the training. By alternating the elections at every training step (instead of training on each election sequentially), I hope to capture a more robust relationship underlying electoral geographical distributions. Note that I start by dropping 90% of the nodes in the dropout layer, going down to 50% as the training progresses.

# Testing is defined as follows. There are 3 functions. The main one (test(year)), is used to test the model's predictions for the treatment groups defined above. Unexpected biases in the predictions of the model are interpreted as the effect of treatment (since we are comparing with the models "counterfactual" predictions).
# 
# The other two are simple test functions, which evaluate the models capabilities to predict vote-shares of a sample of randomly selected cities given the remaining ones' vote-shares in 2022. More precisely: Z is defined above by taking data2022 and setting half of the values of diff to 0. Z_mask is a boolean vector taking value 1 if diff was set to 0 in a particular observation. Here, I evaluate the models ability to predict diff for those cities that had their diff set to 0.
# 
# test_testset() evaluates the model's fit for the test set, whereas test_trainset() evaluates the model's fit for the training set (the latter is mainly to diagnose overfitting in case the accuracy in the training set is much larger than in the test set.)
