# Neural network counterfactuals

More information can be found in the slides and paper attached.

In order to run this code, I suggest opening the jupyter notebook on Google Colab in order to use the free GPU. Create a new cell, clone this directory (!git clone "path"), fix the main directory in the file and run. Running this code without GPU's takes about an hour, and 3 minutes with a GPU.

Feel free to contact me for any suggestions or questions.
